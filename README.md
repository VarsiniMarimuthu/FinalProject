# Burger Bliss: Gourmet Burger Experience with Interactive Chatbot by Varsini M

## The Burger Bliss project aims to enhance the gourmet burger experience by developing a comprehensive website that includes a home page, about section, contact information, menu, and an AI-powered chatbot. The platform will allow customers to explore our offerings, learn more about our story, get in touch with us, and receive personalized assistance and recommendations through the virtual chatbot, ensuring an engaging and interactive visit to our site.

 This integrated healthcare platform is developed as part of the Future Ready Talent Internship program, a collaboration between Microsoft, Future Skills Prime, Quess, Github, and EY,  aims to create an engaging and interactive online platform that enhances the customer experience by combining essential information about our gourmet burger offerings with a user-friendly interface.
